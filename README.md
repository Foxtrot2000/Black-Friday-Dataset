# Black-Friday-Dataset
This dataset comprises of sales transactions captured at a retail store. Itâ€™s a classic dataset to explore and expand your feature engineering skills  and day to day understanding from multiple shopping experiences. This is a regression problem. The dataset has 550,069 rows and 12 columns.


Used Linear Regression,Lasso Regression intially but was not of much use, then after extensive searching found a boosting algorithm for a dataset this big, Used XGBoost which is a gradient boosting algorithm based on the decision tree model. 
Applying XGBoost is the easy part, the difficult part is tweaking the parameters to gain your results. 

After a lot of hit and trial, found these parameters worked the best for me. 
A great learning experience overall.
